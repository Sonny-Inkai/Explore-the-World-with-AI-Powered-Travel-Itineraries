  "description": "Gimnyeong Maze Park (김녕미로공원) is located between the two major tourist destinations of Manjanggul Cave and Gimnyeongsagul Cave. It was designed by the world famous company Adrian Fisher Minotaur Maze Designs and funded by the life-time savings of an American Professor at Cheju National University, Frederic H. Dustin, whose love for Jeju has kept him on the island for 27 years. This unique maze park contains foliages from all over Asia and has been personally maintained by Dr Dunstan since 1987. Gimnyeong Maze Park contains a maze that has seven images incorporated in it. The maze is in the shape of the Jeju Island, and its images that can be clearly seen from above include the following: a serpent, which was an object of worship on the island until the mid-70s; native horses of Jeju Island, which were brought there by Mongolians as far back as 1276; the ship, the Sparrowhawk, that was shipwrecked on the island in 1653 bringing Hendrick Hamel and his company of Dutch sailors to the Joseon Kingdom; and dolmens that are relics from the Bronze Age. All of these images are famous symbols or landmarks of Jeju Island. There are three skywalks called ‘gureum dari’ and an observatory, which are popular photo sites for tourists. They offer panoramic views of the entire maze. There are four ways to get through the maze from the entrance. If you use a map, it will take only 5 minutes, but without a map it’s a bit more difficult and can take up to 20 minutes. Some visitors have been known to spend up to 50 minutes lost in the maze before giving up and calling for help!",

Thanks to his strenuous efforts and strong will, we now have the beautiful garden that represents the quintessence of Jeju. Consisting of 7 small gardens and auxiliary facilities, this Spirited Garden provides spaces where you can find peace of mind surrounded by waterfall, ponds, stone bridges as well as trees. All the garden trees, bunjaes, and stones allows you to relieve yourself from any everyday life burden and to take a respite to enjoy the beauty of the nature. High walls built in order to protect trees from strong winds became castles and the architectures built to house exhibitions and to serve convenience purposes now represent the beauty of the nature in Jeju. They are sure to provide people from around the world with chances to think of a new paradigm of life",

Based on the story, 'Since ancient times, people made wishes on the moon, and the moon became heavy with wishes and fell on Jeju,' it provides immersive experience content enjoyed while walking down the street at night. Lunapol consists of a total of 9 experience zones decorated with realistic media technologies such as media art and holograms. The worldview is richly implemented, including 'Luna Village', which reproduces the Lunapol worldview, the moon people 'Lunarian', and the language used by the moon people, 'Lunarian', further increasing immersion. Lunapol Fantasy, a combination of Lunapol's unique world view, Jeju's clean nature, and top immersive media technology, is a natural protected area containing Gotjawal and includes unpaved forest paths, so be careful about some of the routes, so wear safe and comfortable shoes and clothes. I recommend you.",

With the motto of \"Just Dilecious,\" two owner chefs, who specialize in Spanish and Italian cuisine, are actively using Jeju ingredients to bring out new and diverse flavors and experiences. Western food enjoyed in Jeju can be approached awkwardly. However, I am confident that you can feel a new Jeju and a different Jeju if you visit Efcucina and feel it directly and enjoy it. Perhaps because of this, many people who came by once and the provincial residents have repeatedly revisited, providing a strong support. I will always repay you with delicious and enjoyable experiences. Thank you.",

Visit in April and May for warm waters and comfortable weather or during fall when fewer crowds make for a quieter experience. Book accommodation well in advance if you plan to visit in the summer. – Tripadvisor",

  "description": "This gorgeous island in the Bahamas is known for its crystal-clear waters, pink sand, and nine resident swimming pigs. Enjoy a welcome drink, chill in a hammock, hit up the beach bar, splash around with the adorable pigs, kayak in the sea, and go snorkeling with turtles. Watch out though—there have been shark sightings in the area. The island is just 25 minutes from Nassau and is best visited on a tour or boat charter, which typically includes snorkeling and pig encounters. It's also a great and cheaper alternative to Big Major Cay’s Pig Island. – Tripadvisor",

The crystal-clear waters here are home to diverse marine life, making it a popular spot for snorkeling and diving—you’re bound to spot some tropical fish and even sea urchins if you’re lucky. You can’t stay overnight as the island is part of a nature reserve. Instead, pick a boat tour that will take you there, stopping along the way for snorkeling and sightseeing. Many island hopping tours often include Catalina as a stop, too. – Tripadvisor",

Also, pack a beach umbrella, as there is nothing to shade you from the Florida sun. – Tripadvisor",

I hate leather products that are made with a lot of machines and quickly, and I am tired of finding a product with a beautiful design and learning from a leather craftsman with the thought of making it with my own hands. I start a workshop to make my own bag that is the only one in the world. Nowadays, everyone wants to become something quickly and to achieve something quickly. In addition, the joy of hand-sewing is a little slower, and the beauty of leather that becomes more fashionable as the user asks for traces of time. Jeju Island is an eco-friendly area.

  "description": "Ponnumthuruthu is an island which is situated about 12km south of Varkala. You can board a country boat from Nedunganda and take a tour through the backwaters for about 30 minutes to reach Ponnumthuruthu. This lush island is a perfect getaway for those who seek a break from the hustle and bustle of the urban life. This island is known for the Shiva Parvathi temple, which is also called `Thuruthu kshethram’ by the natives. The temple is situated amidst thick coconut groves, which has grown over the entire stretch. The temple is more than 100 years old and the entire island is Valiyapurackal family property. The temple was in ruins for a long time but about a decade ago, it was rebuilt.Valiyapurackal family owns the island and the temple. The island is a must see, thanks to the enchanting ambience. Even the jetty at Nedunganda village from where the journey to Ponnumthuruthu starts is peculiar. It is a makeshift jetty and the walkway to the ferry is made up of coconut husk, mud and the waste from coir. A view of the island from the ferry during evening will surely soothe any nature-lover’s mind. The greenery of the island will have a distinctive glow when the evening rays of the sun caress it. The island is also a haven of different types of flora and fauna. It will surely be a bird watcher’s delight to visit the island, thanks to the cormorants, egrets and herons seen in this area. Eagles and gulls too can be found here. Various water birds too can be seen here. The mainland on the other side of Ponnumthuruthu is a coir village. There is a small coir-making unit near the ferry. Travellers can visit the unit. It is delighting to view the boats carrying husks waving through the backwaters to reach the island. Sivarathri festival Sivarathri is a major festival celebrated at the Siva Parvathi temple at Ponnumthuruthu. It is the festival that makes alive the otherwise less frequented island. Many devotees spend the night on the island during Sivarathri and the place lit with lights is an enchanting sight.",

  "description": "Take a boat tour around this stunning archipelago off the Connecticut coast. You’ll learn about the area’s history and spot picturesque houses and plenty of marine life along the way. Tours last about 45 minutes and are best enjoyed on sunny days, as the water spray can be somewhat chilly. Alternatively, rent a kayak and paddle all the way to Outer Island, which is home to a wildlife refuge. Here, you’ll get to walk along the rocky shore and have a picnic in the woods. Visit the Thimble Islands in the summer to watch sailing races every weekend. – Tripadvisor",

  "description": "Formed as a result of volcanic activity, this group of uninhabited islands is a great place to spot marine wildlife like dolphins, manta rays, turtles, and even humpback whales during winter. It is best known for the photogenic Hidden Beach, a small bay completely enclosed by rock that can only be accessed by a water tunnel at low tide. Boat tours leave from Punta de Mila that's about 15 minutes away and include a mandatory marine park fee. To prevent over tourism, the number of daily visitors to the beach is limited, so book the tour early to secure your slot. – Tripadvisor",

Wet aging and dry aging are used to alternately ripen for 330 hours, allowing you to taste a different level of meat with a high level of maturity. Bone pork belly is thickly cut whole pork belly with the bone intact and has an excellent chewy taste. Only black and white pork produced in Jeju. Through low-temperature aging and dry aging, we have done our best to prepare until the moment your mouth is satisfied. By insisting on cross-aging, the meat has a softer and chewier texture, and the upgraded savory taste of fat, as well as the synthetic charcoal. You can enjoy a deep flavor with charcoal instead of charcoal. We are proud that the taste of the meat served with a unique sauce called horned hermit crab beef paste is the best among Jungmun black pork restaurants in Seogwipo. It is adjacent to the Jungmun tourist complex, so it is easy to move around, and there is a pick-up service in the Jungmun area. Also available E Channel I Like Food on Saturdays Ep.48 aired YouTube Two Came to Exercise Pier Ep.60 aired Pick-up service in Jungmun area, 909 Iljuseo-ro, Seogwipo-si, Jeju.",

Sir William's vast house, his equally large barn and his bathhouse/artist's hideaway are on view, as are the beautiful carriage lanes through the woods and fields. Time stands still, and you're swept up in an atmosphere that makes you forget all about your everyday life and the here-and-now. Come explore! We're waiting to welcome you.",

The raw lava flows and active volcanoes in these islands resemble the lost world of \"Jurassic Park,\" which seems fitting as these outpost islands, including Roca Partida, beckon not just to giant mantas, but to a host of big animals. The manta behaviour here is unique in the world. The 12-to-16-foot giant mantas of Socorro seek out intimate interactions with divers. Dolphins, whale sharks, humpback whales, silky sharks, hammerhead sharks, tiger sharks and more can also be found here, depending on the time of year. Socorro is accessed by liveaboard dive boats, and promises to be the trip of a lifetime.",

Thriving natural habitats - including woodland, heathland and a lagoon - create a unique haven for wildlife, such as the rare red squirrel and a wide variety of birds, including dunlin, kingfishers, common and sandwich terns and oystercatchers. The Outdoor Centre invites you to come and follow in the footsteps of Lord Baden-Powell and the very first Scouts who camped here in 1907. Spend a night under the stars at the historic campsite and live life like a true Scout whilst you take advantage of the peace and tranquillity of the island when all other visitors have gone home. The perfect day's adventure - this island wildlife sanctuary is easy to get to but feels like another world from the moment you step ashore.",

Mouse Island is often famously photographed with the Church of Panagia Vlacherna—a unique monastery connected to Corfu by a walkway—where ferry boats to the island depart. It's also located close to Corfu's airport runway, so you can have great views of airplanes taking off and landing. If you’re lucky, you might even catch a glimpse of the island's resident peacock. – Tripadvisor",
